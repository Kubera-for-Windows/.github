## ‚ùì What is Kubera?

Kubera is a next-generation wealth management and portfolio tracking platform built for individuals, families, and financial professionals who need a complete, real-time picture of their financial life. Unlike traditional finance apps that focus solely on banking or investments, Kubera consolidates all asset classes‚Äîcash, stocks, bonds, crypto, real estate, private equity, collectibles, and more‚Äîinto one secure, easy-to-navigate dashboard. It is designed to handle complex, multi-currency, and multi-asset portfolios with precision.

The platform connects seamlessly to thousands of banks, brokerages, and financial institutions around the world, automatically syncing balances, transactions, and market values. Cryptocurrency tracking is deeply integrated, enabling users to connect wallets, exchange accounts, and DeFi protocols so digital assets are monitored alongside traditional holdings. Kubera also supports manual entry for alternative investments such as art, gold, or domain names, ensuring no part of your net worth is left unaccounted for.

One of Kubera‚Äôs key strengths is its ability to present your complete net worth over time. Historical performance charts let you see how your wealth has grown and shifted across various asset classes, while detailed allocation breakdowns reveal where your money is concentrated. This allows for smarter diversification and informed decision-making. The platform also offers multi-currency support with live exchange rates, making it ideal for global investors and expatriates.

Beyond portfolio tracking, Kubera offers essential financial organization tools. You can securely store important documents like property deeds, insurance policies, and investment agreements directly within the platform. The built-in beneficiary management feature ensures that, in the event of an emergency, your trusted contacts can access critical account details, providing peace of mind for estate planning.

Kubera‚Äôs design philosophy emphasizes simplicity without sacrificing power. The clean, modern interface is intuitive for casual users while providing the advanced data insights that professional investors demand. Security is a top priority‚Äîdata is encrypted end-to-end, two-factor authentication is supported, and Kubera never sells or shares your personal financial information. For users who value privacy, Kubera offers features like encrypted manual entries that remain completely under your control.

Integration with real-time market data providers means your valuations are always up to date, whether you‚Äôre tracking U.S. stocks, European bonds, Asian real estate, or global cryptocurrencies. The system automatically updates asset prices and exchange rates so your net worth reflects the most current conditions. You can even set alerts for major value changes or asset performance thresholds.

For financial advisors and wealth managers, Kubera can be used as a client reporting tool, enabling them to present holistic views of a client‚Äôs assets without requiring access to actual funds. For individual investors, it is a personal financial command center, replacing the need for multiple disconnected apps.

Whether you are a high-net-worth individual managing complex global assets, a crypto investor balancing multiple wallets, or simply someone who wants an accurate and private view of your financial life, Kubera provides the tools to monitor, analyze, and plan effectively. By combining comprehensive asset coverage, automation, and strong security, it delivers a modern, all-in-one solution for wealth tracking in the digital age.
